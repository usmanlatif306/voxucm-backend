        <p>
            Cookies are small text files that are sent to and stored on your
            computer, smart phone or other device for accessing the internet,
            whenever you visit our website. Each cookie is unique to your web
            browser. It will contain some anonymous information such as a unique
            identifier and the site name and some digits and numbers. Cookies
            are specific to the server that created them and cannot be accessed
            by other servers, which means that they cannot be used to track your
            movements elsewhere around the web. Please note that passwords and
            credit card numbers are not stored in cookies.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most websites visited will use cookies in order to improve your user
            experience by enabling that website to 'remember' you, either for
            the duration of your visit (using a 'session cookie') or for repeat
            visits (using a 'persistent cookie').
        </p>

        <p>
            Most websites use cookies for a variety of reasons, such as to
            determine preferences, let users navigate between pages efficiently,
            verify the user and carry out other essential security, these are
            all termed as ‘non-evasive’.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cookies make the interaction between you and the website faster and
            easier. If a website doesn't use cookies, it will think you are a
            new visitor every time you move to a new page on the site – for
            example, when you enter your login details and move to another page
            it won't recognise you and it won't be able to keep you logged in.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cookies may be set by the website you are visiting ('first party
            cookies') or they may be set by other websites who run content on
            the page you are viewing ('third party cookies').
        </p>
        <p>
            We don't sell the information collected by cookies, nor do we
            disclose the information to third parties, except where required by
            law (for example to government bodies and law enforcement agencies).
