            administrative purposes, we may need to pass the information we

            which were the subject of a previous sale to you. If you do not want
            us to use your data in this way, or to pass your details on to third
            parties for marketing purposes, please do not tick the relevant box
            during the sign up process.

            We do not disclose information about identifiable individuals to our
            advertisers, but we may provide them with aggregate information
            about our users (for example, we may inform them that 500 men aged
            under 30 have clicked on their advertisement on any given day). We
            may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach
            the kind of audience they want to target (for example, women in
            SW1). We may make use of the personal data we have collected from
            you to enable us to comply with our advertisersâ€™ wishes by
            displaying their advertisement to that target audience.
